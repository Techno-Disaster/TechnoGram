# Technogram

Technogram is a project that I started to improve my Android Development knowledge and the first of my speed coding UI series. Later on I have decided to make it public, open source and maybe i will publish it on Play Store.

It uses [Firebase's](https://firebase.google.com) Authentication/Database/Storage/Messaging/CrashReporting libraries for it's implementation and several other libraries.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
